# Twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-Python-Machine-Learning

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is the process of using Python to understand the emotions or opinions expressed in tweets automatically. By analyzing the text we can classify tweets as positive, negative or neutral. This helps businesses and researchers track public mood, brand reputation or reactions to events in real time. Python libraries like TextBlob, Tweepy and NLTK make it easy to collect tweets, process the text and perform sentiment analysis efficiently.

For this project, we will be analysing the sentiment of people towards Pfizer vaccines. We will be using the data available on Kaggle to create this machine learning model. The collected tweets from Twitter will be analysed using machine learning to identify the different sentiments present in the tweets. The different sentiments identified in this project include positive sentiment, negative sentiment and neutral sentiment. We will also be using different classifiers to see which classifier gives the best model accuracy.

How is Twitter Sentiment Analysis Useful?
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is important because it helps people and businesses understand what the public thinks in real time.
Millions of tweets are posted every day, sharing opinions about brands, products, events or social issues. By analyzing this huge stream of data, companies can measure customer satisfaction, spot trends early, handle negative feedback quickly and make better decisions based on how people actually feel.
Itâ€™s also useful for researchers and governments to monitor public mood during elections, crises or big events as it turns raw tweets into valuable insights.
